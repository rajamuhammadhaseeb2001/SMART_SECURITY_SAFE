# SMART_SECURITY_SAFE
This code creates a smart safe lock system with an Arduino, keypad, LCD, and Bluetooth module. It checks a user-entered password against three predefined passwords. If correct, it opens the safe and displays a message; if incorrect, it shows an error. LEDs indicate the safe's status (open or closed).
